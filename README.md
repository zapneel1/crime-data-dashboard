# Manhattan Crime Visualization Dashboard

![Crime Visualization Dashboard](/data/project-thumbnail.png)

Visualization project that features NYPD Crime Dataset from 2019 to 2021. The dataset has been narrowed down to include only Manhattan borough, reducing the amount of datapoints from 206K to just 11K.

## Dataset

More information about the dataset can be found on [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-Year-To-Date-/5uac-w243).

## Further plans

Since I switched to a specialization track in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, I plan on training a Generative ML model on the whole dataset to predict the location and time of potential crimes.
